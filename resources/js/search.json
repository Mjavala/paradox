This means that starting at the 28 day threshold, bonus tokens will be alloted given by the following formula:","Note that the length multiplier increases linearly until the bonus has reached twice as much as the initially staked amount."]},{"l":"P-Save","p":["When a user stakes $PARA, that stake is distributed throughout the ecosystem.","33% is Burned.","33% is distributed to the rewards pool.","33% is distributed to the staking pool.","These values will all be upgradeable, and there will be an option to turn off burn.","The user is then credited an equivalent amount of the P-Save virtual currency, which is the basis for all staking rewards calculations. Essentially, a virtual pool is used to determine a users share in the pool. A users pending rewards are then calculated by the following formula:","The function variables are defined below:","Variable","Description","Reward A","Reward based on the amount staked, defined above.","Reward L","Reward based on the length of the stake, defined above."]},{"l":"User Flow","p":["What follows is an example of two users, Alice and Bob, who both deposit 10 $PARA stakes for 200 days. This example assumes that the contract has enough funds to cover their stakes. Please see the Mitigating Risks section for developer thoughts on that.","Alice and bob will receive a negligible amount multiplier but the length multiplier bonus will be roughly 1.7 $PARA, or a 17% yield."]},{"l":"Mitigating Risks","p":["It is entirely possible, without some sort of automated service monitoring the contract, for the staking pool balance to be superceded by a users pending rewards. In this case where the contract can't cover the amount, the contract should be intelligent enough to pause operations until more funds are deposited.","For this reason the developer would recommend making the $PARA token inflationary, such that more can be minted in the case that other parts of the ecosystem are not generating enough $PARA flow to the staking contract."]}],[{"l":"Protocol Interactions"}]]
